               <h2 class="my-5">Overview</h2>
               <p>This is my master’s thesis. I combined UX design and psychology to encourage supporters to donate repeatedly. Here is a quick summary.</p>
          
               <ul class="ml-3">
                    <li>Supporters are not willing to donate because they lack motivation.</li>
                    <li>Identify supporters’ needs by adopting a user-centric approach.</li>
                    <li>Gamifying donation experience keeps supporters motivated and engaged.</li>
               </ul>

               <h2 class="my-5">Background</h2>
          <div class="row">
               <p class="col-7">When we talk about tennis players, most people start thinking their astronomical wages or massive prize money. That is only part of the truth, some top players indeed earn a decent living. However, in reality, ​countless players are fighting to stay above the poverty line.  International Tennis Federation indicates that the annual costs for a high-performance tennis player is $38,800, and a typical pro tennis player would train around 6 to 8 hours a day. They don't have time to take on a second job, which means they don’t have income to cover these huge expenses. Therefore, the young players’ career may be cut short due to financial difficulties. There are numerous career options in the world, but it is absurd that this profession makes vast majority unable to make ends meet.</p>

               </div>

               <p>Top tennis players reach their peak performance at the age of 24 and remain a top competitor for about 5 years. As a result, 24 can be a critical moment. If a player cannot break through the threshold before 24, their performance will gradually decline, and it is less likely they will make a living from playing tennis. The threshold is the break-even point, where the annual costs of a tennis player are equal to their prize money earnings.</p>
               <h2 class="my-5">State-of-the-art</h2>
               <p>One of the powerful method to help these young talents is crowdfunding. It is not uncommon for crowdfunding platforms aims to help promising athletes with limited financial resources. There are three primary types of crowdfunding in the sports industry:</p>
               <ul class="ml-3">
                    <li>Reward-based crowdfunding</li>
                    <li>Donation-based crowdfunding</li>
                    <li>Equity-based crowdfunding</li>
               </ul>
               <p>There are different reasons that people browse these platforms and click buttons to help athletes. Motivation is what drives them towards such action. Psychologists have proposed two main types of motivation: intrinsic and extrinsic. Intrinsic motivation has been defined as doing activities just for inherent enjoyment. People do it because it is enjoyable, or their curiosity was satisfied. By contrast, extrinsic motivation refers to performing a behavior or engaging in an activity because it contributes to an external reward, or avoids an unpleasant consequence, which is known by people as the carrot-and-stick approach. Based on this definition, donation-based crowdfunding can be regarded as the application of intrinsic motivation, while equity-based crowdfunding takes advantage of extrinsic motivation, and reward-based crowdfunding is a hybrid form offering both intrinsic and extrinsic motivation.</p>
               <p>Fogg’s behavior model asserts that behavior happens when a person is sufficiently motivated, has the ability to do it, and a trigger comes together at the same moment.</p>
               <figure class="pop">
                    <img src="stellar/images/FoggBehaviorModel.jpg" alt="Fogg Behavior Model" class="mx-auto d-block" width="400">
                    <figcaption>Fogg Behavior Model</figcaption>
               </figure>
               
               
          <div class="row">
               <p class="col-md-7 col-sm-12 my-auto">The checkout interface of crowdfunding platforms are similar or even simpler to the other online shopping checkout interface, apple.com, for example. In addition, 96% of people in the United States of America are shopping online, and 80% make online purchases in the last month alone. People are not incapable of donating, but they are not willing to donate. Therefore, according to Fogg's behavior model, the only factor that affects whether a platform visitor donates or not is motivation.</p>
               <figure class="col-md-4 col-sm-6 my-md-auto my-sm-5 ml-md-auto mx-sm-auto pop">

               <img src="stellar/images/checkout.jpg" alt="Checkout interfaces" width="100%" class="mx-auto d-block" >

               <figcaption>Checkout interfaces</figcaption>
               </figure>
          </div>

               <p class="my-5">Users on reward-based crowdfunding platforms are either intrinsically motivated, extrinsically motivated, or both, therefore, reward-based crowdfunding platforms engage more donors and earn more donations.</p>
               <figure class="col-md-8 col-sm-10 my-5 mx-auto pop">
                    <img src="stellar/images/motivation.jpg" alt="Motivation" width="100%" class="mx-auto d-block">
                    <figcaption>Motivation</figcaption>
               </figure>
               <p>However, motivation gradually fades away over time. One of the methods to keep supporters motivated is to make the activity fun. If donating could be fun as a game, then supporters will come back again and again, they might be addicted to this “game.”</p>
               <h2 class="my-5">Results</h2>
          <div class="row">
               <p class="col-lg-8 col-md-12 my-auto">This is a reward-based crowdfunding platform. I insert gameplay elements in the platform to enhance user engagement. The user in this “game” collects points and badges by financially contributing to tennis players. When the user accumulates a certain amount of points, they can progress to the next level and receive level-up rewards. The higher the user’s level, the greater the rewards they will receive. The rewards can range from discounts on the lowest tier of events on tennis tours to complimentary first row seats at Wimbledon. The user can also redeem rewards after collecting a certain number of badges. Because earning badges is more challenging, therefore players will receive better rewards. For example , to unlock a “Scout badge,” the user has to be the first contributor of a tennis player, their single contribution needs to exceed a specific threshold, and get 3 likes from players.</p>
               <figure class="col-8 col-lg-4 col-md-6 my-lg-auto my-3 mx-auto">
                    <img src="stellar/images/badges.gif" alt="Gamification" width="80%" class="mx-auto d-block">
               </figure>
          </div>
               <p class="mt-md-5">Not everyone is a philanthropist. Rational users want to support young tennis players, but they also feel like they are getting something in return. Therefore, the amount of money a user spends on the tennis players is approximately equivalent to the value of the reward ticket. For instance, the user has to contribute around USD 25 towards tennis players to reach level 2, and that user will receive an ATP Tour 250 round of 16 ticket, which is valued at approximately USD 25, as a level 2 reward.</p>

               <figure class="col-md-6 col-sm-8 my-5 mx-auto pop">

               </figure>

               <p>A user sponsors a player so that the player is able to enter the tournament, and players provide exciting tennis matches to the tournament organizer. Once the organizers have exciting content, they can attract more people to attend events as well as increase revenue from marketing and broadcasting rights. Next, organizers can give back to the users by providing free tickets. Unsold seats are common in the tennis games, so it is financially viable to give them to users. Therefore, this could be more than just a platform design, this is an ecosystem that creates a win-win-win situation.</p>

               <p>The following sections introduce the features of this platform.</p>
               <h2 class="my-5">Home Tab</h2>
          <div class="row">
               <p class="col-lg-8 col-md-12 my-auto">The home tab is a curated section that users will see after launching the app, which showcases young talents and helps users find new favorites. It is a daily destination with original stories, news and behind-the-scenes interviews from editors, presenting star of the day, all-time beloved, newly debuted players, and more. Users can just tap on a card to get to know better a certain player. The home tab is fundamental and important because it attracts more donations for lesser-known players by increasing their presence and then expand their fan base. Players can find a certain player by searching for specific words or phrases, and they will receive relevant results for players, as well as stories, news and more. Players’ basic data, such as photos and names are shown publicly to not only help users find what they are looking for and interested in but also allow users to sort the list in the desired order.</p>
               <figure class="col-8 col-lg-4 col-md-6 my-lg-auto my-3 mx-auto">

               <div class="col-lg-8 col-md-12 my-auto">
                    <p>Users are publicly listed and ranked by the points they have earned (points leaderboard), funding contributed to players (funded leaderboard), and their players’ improvement (improvement leaderboard) within a certain period. Funded leaderboard and points leaderboard reset every week and the user is compared to similar peers at the same level, so it will not always be dominated by the same users and avoid demotivation of newcomers and low ranked users.</p>
                    <p>The highest player on the leaderboard by the end of the period could earn the best rewards (e.g. 1000 points or a finals ticket), 2nd place will gain secondary rewards (e.g. 500 points or a semifinals ticket), 3rd place can receive tertiary rewards (e.g. 250 points or a quarterfinals ticket), and so on and so forth.</p>

               <p class="col-lg-8 col-md-12 my-auto">Activity tab brings users closer to players they love and allows fans to be part of their journey to stardom. The platform gives players a place where they are free to share their competition photos, training videos, results of matches, schedule or even announce an urgent need for funding for flights directly to users and fans. Users can browse a feed of the players they follow, and they can like or make comments about anything a player has posted.</p>

Everyone can access the user’s profile tab by tapping a user’s photo on the leaderboard or player’s sponsors page. Exhibiting a user’s achievements aims to exert social influence on others (e.g., showing a rare badge that can only be acquired after reaching specific milestones), thereby fostering motivation.</p>

               <h2 class="my-5">The Player's Space</h2>
               <p>Once a user has found a player that interests them, they can click player’s card or button to view their detailed information, such as age, height, weight, nationality, ranking, movement on the ranking, win/loss records, number of titles, likes, supporters, comments and funding progress. This page is designed to provide at-a-glance information about the current tennis player. If the user wants to discover more about a player, they can scroll down to the player’s space, which includes Bio, Progress, Community, and Sponsors.</p>
               <p>Bio is where players tell users their stories, what they have accomplished so far, how they came to their current position, how important sport is to them, why upcoming competitions matter, explain why they are raising money via crowdfunding, and state their ambitions and athletic goals. They can also share footage and photos of their competing or training. It is a place where players convince users that they are supporting something meaningful and make them feel their donation will have an impact.</p>
               <p>Progress is similar to the activity tab but focuses exclusively on one player. Its feed delivers player’s news, scores, stats, photos, videos and more in chronological order. Users can learn more about what is happening with the player or find out where the player is touring. And all posts include detail information so that the user can dig deeper.</p>
          <div class="row">
               <div class="col-lg-8 col-md-12 my-auto">
               <p>Community is where sponsors and fans write their messages of support to tennis players, it also features a real-time sponsor roll that displays sponsors’ names (donors can also opt to remain anonymous to the public) and contribution amounts as they come in. Players can respond directly to comments and messages of sponsors and fans to boost engagement.</p>
               <p>Users’ names will be displayed in the Sponsors page and are arranged from top to bottom in descending order of their contribution. The following sponsorship tiers are determined seasonally by the amount of support that has been given by the user – Diamond Sponsor (the user who contributes the most), Platinum Sponsor (the 2nd to 4th highest contributors) and Gold Sponsor (the 5th to 9th contributors). And top sponsors can gain exclusive badges and get recognition for the significant role they play in a player’s success. Apart from that, they can also receive acknowledgment letters or commemorative gifts from players.</p>

The user can access the contribution page by tapping the floating button. The contribution page displays the number of sponsors, days remaining, and more detailed fundraising progress. The user can buy a symbolic gift that represents a real need – anything from a tennis ball to a sport outfit. When a user buys a symbolic gift, the price of that good or service is then contributed to the tennis player. The user can also choose how much they would like to contribute.</p>

               <h2 class="my-5">Feasibility Analysis</h2>
               <p>Top tennis players reach their peak performance at the age of 24 and remain a top competitor for about 5 years. As a result, 24 can be a critical moment. If a player cannot break through the threshold before 24, their performance will gradually decline, and it is less likely they will make a living from playing tennis. The threshold is the break-even point, where the annual expenses of a tennis player (USD 38,800 for men and USD 40,180 for women) are equal to their prize money earnings. The break-even point in 2019 was 394 for men and 253 for women. Therefore, the target of this platform is tennis players ages 18 to 24 and ranked below the break-even point. According to ATP and WTA, there are 1066 male players and 664 female players who meet these conditions. To support all of them for a year is around USD 68,040,320 in total. The potential users of the platform are tennis fans who are familiar with digital technologies, which could be represented by ATP website visitors. There are around 2.862 million monthly unique visitors to the official site of ATP and an estimated 69% of these people will donate. Therefore, it can be reasonably estimated that each user on this platform only needs to spend USD 37.21* to help all target players. According to statistics, Germans donate nearly six times a year, the average gift being EUR 35 (USD 38.9); Brits donate an average of GBP 44 (USD 57.7) per month; USD 128 is the average online U.S. American donation amount. Based on the above data, it can be speculated that supporting these up and coming players is very feasible.</p>
               <p><small>* 68,040,320×1.08(operational costs)÷(2,862,000×0.69)</small></p>
               <h2 class="my-5">Outlook</h2>
               <p>The young player’s career may be cruelly cut short due to financial difficulties. Although different solutions exist today, they still do not solve the problem effectively. This research presents a design proposal of the reward-based crowdfunding platform specifically for players with economic hardship by applying a gamification approach that aims to boost donor acquisition for players. This platform should be a joint initiative of ITF, ATP, and WTA to effectively implement the results of this research. Also, they are the tournament organizers with the ability to allocate tickets; only they can provide required information to calculate the points and redemption rates for free tickets.</p>
