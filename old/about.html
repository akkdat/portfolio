               <p>Hello,</p>
               <p>I'm an interdisciplinary designer.</p>
               <p>Thank you for taking the time to explore my works. I just received a Master's degree from Integrated Design program at Köln International School of Design. Prior to that, I was a UX engineer. My job was to conduct user research, investigate industrial accidents and proposed design strategies.</p>
               <p>I'm curious and always eager to learn. I like to keep an eye out for human behavior in daily life. For me, every design project is a unique journey. My goal is to create a brilliant design that not only solves problems but also provides a delightful experience.</p>
               <p>Outside of design, I'm a tennis enthusiast, a foodie traveler, a tech-savvy person.</p></div>
